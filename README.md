# GROUP-6-CODING
# Overview
This repository contains collaborative coding projects by Group 6. The focus areas include real-world application scenarios such as:

A recycling buses allocation system that matches buses based on load capacity and minimum fuel consumption.
A ride hailing application that matches users with nearby drivers.
A hospital resource management system for efficient tracking and allocation of medical resources.

The codebase is composed primarily of Kotlin, Python, and JavaScript.

# Question 1
Recycling Collection Routing: Implement a routing system for recycling collection trucks that optimizes routes to minimize fuel consumption and maximize load efficiency. This system should handle variable recycling volumes, special pickups for over sized items, and ensure compliance with local recycling regulations and schedules.

# Question 2
You are building a ride hailing app. Given the userâ€™s current location, what approach would you recommend for efficiently identifying and presenting nearby drivers within the application?
