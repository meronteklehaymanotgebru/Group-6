Input
Drivers list (containing Id, location(Longitude, Latitude)), User's location(Longitude,Latitude), Maximum ditsnace

Output 
The list of nearby drivers.


1. Create a list of drivers with their id and location.
2. For each driver in the driver list, do steps 3â€“5.
3. From the driver's location longitude subtract the user's location longitude.
4. From the driver's location latitude subtract the user's location latitude.
5. Using the Pythagorean theorem from the difference of the longitude and latitude calculate the distance between the user's location and the driver's location.
6. If the distance is less than or equal to the maximum distance, go to step 7.
7. Create a list of nearby drivers.
